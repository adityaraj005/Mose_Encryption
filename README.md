Morse Code Encryptor/Decryptor
This project is a Python script that allows you to convert text into Morse code and vice versa. It includes two main functions:

Encrypt: Converts plain text into Morse code using a predefined dictionary of characters and their Morse code equivalents.
Decrypt: Converts Morse code back into readable text, handling both letters and numbers.
Example Usage
Encrypting Text
bash
Copy code
Do you want to Encrypt your message or Decrypt your message? (Encrypt: 0 / Decrypt: 1): 0
Enter the String/Text for Encryption: Hello World
Your Output: .... . .-.. .-.. --- / .-- --- .-. .-.. -.. 
Decrypting Morse Code
bash
Copy code
Do you want to Encrypt your message or Decrypt your message? (Encrypt: 0 / Decrypt: 1): 1
Enter the Text for Decryption: .... . .-.. .-.. --- / .-- --- .-. .-.. -..
Your Output: HELLO WORLD
This script is straightforward and useful for basic encryption and decryption of messages using Morse code.
